# ALFA UAV Fault Detection

Applying Machine Learning on the [ALFA dataset](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/ALFA_A_Dataset_for_UAV_Fault_and_Anomaly_Detection/12707963?file=24095870) for UAV fault detection. 

- `data-processing`: Notebooks for data processing, e.g., time series feature extraction
- `model-training`: Notebooks for training and optimizing various machine learning models, e.g. MiniRocket, Mcfly AutoML, Sktime
- `cross-validation`: Notebooks for model validation and performance evaluation
